# Engineering

Engineering begins with the shared requirements contract and follows it through design, pre-release evidence, continuous delivery, and production learning.

## Lifecycle

| Document | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md) | How domain boundaries and system components satisfy the requirements. |
| [`TESTING.md`](TESTING.md) | How tests and CI prove the system before release. |
| [`PUBLISHING.md`](PUBLISHING.md) | How verified artifacts are versioned, promoted, deployed, and rolled back. |
| [`OBSERVABILITY.md`](OBSERVABILITY.md) | How production health and user outcomes are measured and fed back into discovery. |
| [`adrs/`](adrs/) | Why significant product and technical decisions were made. |

## Supporting documentation

| Document | Description |
|---|---|
| _(none yet)_ | Add setup/runbooks only when needed beyond README + lifecycle docs |

## Decision records

```sh
docslime add adr <short-slug>
```

Keep the decision log in [`adrs/README.md`](adrs/README.md) synchronized with accepted, superseded, and deprecated records.
